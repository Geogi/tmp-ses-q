tmp-ses-q
=========

Test project with SES (https://code.google.com/p/google-caja/) and Q (https://github.com/kriskowal/q).
Under GPL license.

Uses SES (part of Google Caja, Apache 2.0 license) and Q (MIT license).

Notes: I still can't figure out how exactly to use SES, so for now I've duplicated their `explicit.html` as `index.html` with my own scripts loaded at the end. The reports displayed in HTML come from the original file, see the JS console for actual the experiment results.
